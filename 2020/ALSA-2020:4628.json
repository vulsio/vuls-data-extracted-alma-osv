			"description": "LibreOffice is an open source, community-developed office productivity suite. It includes key desktop applications, such as a word processor, a spreadsheet, a presentation manager, a formula editor, and a drawing program. LibreOffice replaces OpenOffice and provides a similar but enhanced and extended office suite.\n\nThe following packages have been upgraded to a later upstream version: libreoffice (6.3.6.2), libcmis (0.5.2), liborcus (0.14.1). (BZ#1796893)\n\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\n* libreoffice: 'stealth mode' remote resource restrictions bypass (CVE-2020-12802)\n\n* libreoffice: forms allowed to be submitted to any URI could result in local file overwrite (CVE-2020-12803)\n\nFor more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.\n\nAdditional Changes:\n\nFor detailed information on changes in this release, see the AlmaLinux Release Notes linked from the References section.",
