			"title": "Moderate: libwebp security update",
			"description": "The libwebp packages provide a library and tools for the WebP graphics format. WebP is an image format with a lossy compression of digital photographic images. WebP consists of a codec based on the VP8 format, and a container based on the Resource Interchange File Format (RIFF). Webmasters, web developers and browser developers can use WebP to compress, archive, and distribute digital images more efficiently.\n\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\n* libwebp: out-of-bounds read in WebPMuxCreateInternal (CVE-2018-25009)\n\n* libwebp: out-of-bounds read in ApplyFilter() (CVE-2018-25010)\n\n* libwebp: out-of-bounds read in WebPMuxCreateInternal() (CVE-2018-25012)\n\n* libwebp: out-of-bounds read in ShiftBytes() (CVE-2018-25013)\n\n* libwebp: use of uninitialized value in ReadSymbol() (CVE-2018-25014)\n\n* libwebp: out-of-bounds read in ChunkVerifyAndAssign() in mux/muxread.c (CVE-2020-36330)\n\n* libwebp: out-of-bounds read in ChunkAssignData() in mux/muxinternal.c (CVE-2020-36331)\n\n* libwebp: excessive memory allocation when reading a file (CVE-2020-36332)\n\nFor more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.\n\nAdditional Changes:\n\nFor detailed information on changes in this release, see the AlmaLinux Release Notes linked from the References section.",
